projectTitle2=A VISUALIZATION OF TOLSTOY’S INTELLECTUAL WORLD

titleMission=Our Mission

par1=At 63, Leo Tolstoy set out to write a list of a hundred books that had made a deep impression on him. But compiling the list was slow going; it was not so easy to remember which books had been significant, and when. Some did remain clear in his memory: “Childhood to about 14 years old: The story of Joseph in the Bible…Pushkin’s poems. 14 to 20 years old: The Gospel of Matthew: Sermon on the Mount…Rousseau’s <i>Confessions</i>…Schiller’s <i>The Robbers</i>…" In the end, though, his list numbered only around fifty titles—a small fraction of the many works he had read and contemplated throughout his long life. This project, <i>Beyond the Ant Brotherhood</i>, aims to pick up where Tolstoy left off in cataloguing the various books, people, and events that made an impression on him.

par2=We have created a web platform that presents dynamic timelines of Tolstoy’s life, offering a synoptic yet fine-grained view of his intellectual development, of a kind that cannot be achieved by traditional humanistic methods. Our objective is to allow users to visually juxtapose various aspects of Tolstoy’s life—what he was reading, what he was writing, with whom he was corresponding, and so on—by placing them on correlated timelines. We hope that by enabling users to move between minute details and a broad view of Tolstoy’s intellectual life, these visualizations will not only facilitate traditional research on Tolstoy but also open up new lines of inquiry.

par3=The corpus of Tolstoy’s diaries and letters consists of more than 10,000 documents—4,122 diary entries and 8,562 letters. The sheer volume can be intimidating to even the most seasoned Tolstoy scholars. Where do you start? How do you find items of interest? Typically you have to know what to look for in advance; then, you might track your chosen subject across multiple volumes of writing. This process is not only laborious but also limited by what you already know, by the questions you formulate in advance. Our site allows for both greater efficiency and a more exploratory approach. This data is easily searchable in various ways. You can, for example, do a keyword search to see where certain topics appear in the diaries and letters; or you can search for certain correspondents of Tolstoy’s and peruse the letters he exchanged with them; or you can use the literary works timeline to limit your search to, say, only those letters he wrote while at work on <i>Anna Karenina</i>. By making it easier for users to explore this corpus from multiple points of entry, we hope to make it approachable to experts and casual readers alike.

par4=We are grateful to the Tolstoy State Museum and the team at Tolstoy.ru, who have digitized Tolstoy’s ninety-volume collected works and made it freely available to all readers. In the same Tolstoyan spirit, we hope that our visualization will make Tolstoy’s writing more broadly accessible.

titleUsingPlatform=Using the Dynamic Archive

par5=The following short videos introduce our project and give some tips on how to use the site, but they are not prescriptive. We want you to play with the features, to see what else you might find useful, and to tell us about it. This is an ongoing project that means to respond to users’ needs and to improve in functionality. We eagerly welcome your feedback and suggestions.

titleSampleSearch=Sample Search

parSampleSearch=Below is a sample search that selects all of Tolstoy’s letters and diaries for the time period from 1840 to 1910 that mention <i>War and Peace</i> ( «Война и мир»). The number of documents is plotted on the middle timeline. The plot initially shows the number of documents per month, but as you zoom in on a particular time period—by using the gray adjustable bar on the bottom timeline—the plot switches to documents per week and per day. This is just one of the features of the dynamic archive. Information retrieval is based on modern indexing techniques and allows for partial matching, proximity search, and search within various sections of a document. Please watch the Tips for Users video to learn about additional features and check out other search examples by clicking on the link to the left of the search text box.

titleOnSources=Note on Sources

par6=The scholarly commentaries in L. N. Tolstoi, <i>Polnoe sobranie sochinenii v 90 tomakh.</i> (Moskva: Gosudarstvennoe izdatel’stvo Khudozhestvennaia literatura, 1928–58) and in L. N. Tolstoi, <i>Sobranie sochinenii v 22 tomakh</i> (Moskva: Gosudarstvennoe izdatel’stvo Khudozhestvennaia literatura, 1978–1985) have served as our sources for the timeline of Tolstoy’s literary works. Since scholarship on Tolstoy continues to progress, and since we hope this platform can serve as a dynamic tool for its users, we would be grateful to hear from those who can offer additions and emendations to the information presented here. Please visit the comments section to send us your suggestions.


titleTimeline=Note on the Literary Works Timeline

par7=If a given event is dated only by season, our literary works timeline represents it by way of a range of dates for that season (e.g., if Tolstoy spent the summer writing, this period of work would be shown on the timeline as stretching from June 15<sup>th</sup> to September 15<sup>th</sup>). If an event is dated only by month and year we represent it by placing it on the 15<sup>th</sup> of that month. We make note of the precision of the dating as either accurate or approximate.


titleTech=Note on Technology

par8=We used Java and JavaScript programming languages as well as a wide range of Open Source frameworks, including Apache Software Foundation, Elastic, D3.js, among others. The source code is hosted on GitHub where you can learn more about this project’s systems architecture and underlying components. The system have been tested in latest versions of Safari, Google Chrome, and Firefox and is not guaranteed to work in earlier versions or in other types of browsers.

getSearchExamplesTitle=Search Examples - Click on a link below to see one of the examples in action.
getGeneralSearchPrincipleLabel=Please click on one of the links below to learn about different ways of querying the data. You can modify each example by inputting new search terms and pressing “enter.” You can then manipulate how you see the results by adjusting the timescale (bar in gray), double-clicking on the literary works timelines or work titles, clicking on the scatterplot, or scrolling down to the documents themselves.
searchExampleOne=Искусство
searchExampleOneExp=– Simple search for a term appearing anywhere in a document.
searchExampleTwo=content: декад*
searchExampleTwoExp=– Wildcard search for a partial match that finds декаденты, декадентство, etc., anywhere in the “content” (as opposed to the commentators’ “notes”) of a letter.
searchExampleThree="Война и мир"
searchExampleThreeExp=– Simple search for a complete phrase appearing anywhere in a document. You must put quotations around the phrase. 
searchExampleFour=((войн*  AND мир* ) OR Каренин*) AND toWhom: Страхову
searchExampleFourExp=– A more complex search. Simply searching for “война и мир” will not yield all the permutations of the novel’s title that might be relevant to your query because the use of asterisks in quoted strings is not supported (i.e., you will not see results such as “войну и мир”, “войне и мире,” etc.) You must therefore use union keywords shown (AND, OR) to join terms with wildcards. Now the string will match “войны и мира”, “войну и мир”, and so on. Note, however, that this search will also match documents where the words “war” and “peace” are placed far apart and may not refer to Tolstoy’s novel. 

searchExampleFive=Hugo OR Гюго
searchExampleFiveExp=– Search for mentions of a name in English or Russian. Note that OR, AND, NOT must be capitalized. These are logical operators and work interchangeably with their Russian equivalents И, ИЛИ, НЕТ. The search terms themselves, however, are not case sensitive; upper-case letters will be converted to lower case (i.e., Hugo becomes hugo).

searchExampleEight="искусство народ"~10 OR "искусство народа"~10
searchExampleEightExp= – А proximity search to find the words “искусство” and “народ” within 10 words of each other. Again, wildcards are not supported in quoted strings so you will want to use several word combinations joined by OR in order to find all relevant results.

searchExampleSix=религи* NOT toWhom: Черткову
searchExampleSixExp=– А search with negation. The term “religion” must appear in the document but all letters addressed to Чертков are excluded from the search results. Please note that you cannot search by excluding certain terms only. In other words, your search string must start with a term that does appear in the documents.

searchExampleSeven=+религи*  -toWhom: Черткову
searchExampleSevenExp=- The same search as above but using plus/minus operators. A plus operator in front of a search term indicates that the term must appear and a minus indicates that it must be excluded from the search results.


searchExampleNote=Our search uses Apache Lucene Query Parser Syntax. In addition, our system allows you to do a search entirely in Russian by replacing boolean operators AND, OR, NOT with И, ИЛИ, НЕТ. Alternatively, you can use the plus/minus operators as in the last example. Please read more about the syntax at <a  href='https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html#Overview' target='_blank'>lucene.apache.org</a>. Diaries contain the following sections (“fields,” in search terminology): “date”, “place”, “entry”, and “source”. Letters contain “date”, “place”, “content”, “notes”, “source”, and “toWhom”. In your search, you may specify a field. If you do not specify a field, all of them will be searched.
