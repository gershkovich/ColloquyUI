Dear Sir,
I have sent you back your M. S. because I have a longtime ago given my Authorisation to translate, print, dramatize and do all what they whish with my writings and now have nor leisure nor interest to review the translations or dramatizations of my works.
Please excuse me for not fulfilling your wish, but truly I can not do it.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
14 April 1903.
Милостивый государь,
Искренно ваш
Лев Толстой.
