Robert Hunter, Highland Farm, Noroton Heights, Conn. U. S. N. America. О его книге: on Poverty.
Dear sir!
I received your book and only looked through it, but will read it. The theme of it has been always and is of greatest interest to me. I remember with great pleasure your Mrs. Hunter and your visit[1] and was glad to have news from you. I thank you for your letter and your book. My kind remembrance to Mrs. H[unter].
Yours truly Leo Tolstoy.
