Dear Mr. Conger,
Thank you for your letter of April 7/20.
Not to mention those american writers who are nearest to me in spirit, such as Henry George, his son,[1] Ernest Crosby[2] — others, my attitude towards the American Press in general can only be that of simpathy and gratefulness for its kind relation towards me. It is therefore with a feeling of sincere pleasure that I beg you to kindly transmit my cordial greetings to «The Associated Press» of America.
Yours faithfully
L. T.
