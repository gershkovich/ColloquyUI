D[ear] F[riend] and B[rother]. Thank you for your kind letter. It gave me great joy to know that you approve of my ideas on Christianity (I received the tracts that you sent me[1]) and was very satisfied with your views upon the diffe[re]nt expressions of religious sentiments suiting the age of those to whom they are directed. I received the tracts you sent me and read them not only with interest but with profit, and cannot criticise them because I agree with everything that is said in them. There is only one question that I should wish to ask you. You are, as I know non-resistants. How do you manage to keep communial, but nevertheless property? Do you acknowledge the possibility for a Christian to defend property from usurpators? I ask this question because I think that the principle of non-resistance is the chief trait of true Christianity and the greatest difficulty in our time is to be true to it. How do you manage to do so in your community? With sincere respect and love yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
I received your tracts, you say in your letter that [you] have sent me books, did you mean them or did you send me books calling the tracts books? I received more than a year the Oregon paper World Advance Thought, sometimes. I saw in it your articles.[2] I am very thankful to the editor for sending this paper; in every № I get spiritual nourishment if it were not for some spiritistic tendency that is foreign to me. Who is the editor and how long ago has it been founded?
[I] agree with all its religious views. I like this paper very much.
Лев Толстой.
