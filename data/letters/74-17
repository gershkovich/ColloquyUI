Дорогой St. John, I received your letter with the very interesting one of Edw[ard] Blyden, which I am sending you back.[1] «The Midland Herald»[2] reaches me from time to time. Now that I know that you are taking a part in it, I will read it with more attention than I did before. I am very glad to know that you are working in the same [lines] as before and that you are married and happy.
I have been ill and am still very week and therefore do not write myself.
Your affectionate friend Leo Tolstoy.

Дорогой Син-Джон,
Любящий вас друг Лев Толстой.
