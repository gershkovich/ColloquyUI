Dear Sir,
Thank you for your letter and the marked article in the Single Tax Review.[1]
I am very glad to hear, that the question in your country seems advancing. The indifference in Russia to this capital question is an inexplicable puzzle for me. I have tried to propose the system to our members of the government[2] and of the Duma, but they seem all so much occupied with all kinds of supperficial matters, that they have no time and no sense for the capital question. But the question must be solved and very soon. So that I quite agree with you, that there are great times to live in.
Yours truly Loo Tolstoy.
28 March 1908.
Милостивый государь,
Искренне ваш Лев Толстой.
