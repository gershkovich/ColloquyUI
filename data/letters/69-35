My Dear Friend,
I have long ago received your letter with the two papers, one addressed to the Dukhobortzy, and the other to me. I thank with all my heart your friends for what they say to me. I think very often of them and wish to he with them. I have this night dreamed, that I was with you in Croydon and made acquaintance with all our friends, with Mr. Baker and some ladies, and had a great discussion with them on the theme, which is to me always the nearest at heart,— that we must all of us direct all our strength, not on our outer surroundings (I saw in my dream, that yours was a community in a big house), but on our inner life. I am persuaded, that you and your friends know this as well as myself, but I write this only because the dream was so vivid, that I see the faces and remember the words, that have been said.
I am not now in Moscow, but in the conntry, at my friend Olsoufieff. I enjoy the stillness of the country life, and am working but something, that I would like very much to send to you before the summer (for publication).[1]
My best love to you and your friends.
Your brother
Leo Tolstoy.
