* 326. Эдуарду Шиллеру (Edward Schiller). Черновое.
Dear Sir,
Thank you heartily for your letter. To be in communication with your Indian friend will be much more than a pleasure to me. I have a great veneration for the sages of India and although I know something of them, I still wish to learn more and more.
Yours
Милостивый государь,
