* 168. К. О. Хису (Charles Heath). Недоставленное
Dear Mr. Heath,
I think the Emperor is dreadfully cheated. In Samara in April the administration took away from several «molokans» their little children in the most cruel way. There is no reason whatever for those children to be taken away and not others. The parents came to me, asking for help. I could not help them otherwise than by writing a letter to the Emperor, which I sent him through A. Olsoufieff. Now, in «Grajdanine» («Гражданин») Meschersky accuses the missionaries of Kazan of proposing the cruel mesure of taking children from their sectarian parents. So that we are made to believe that that measure cannot be used in Russia. And nevertheless the children are taken away from their parents. The parents are vainly trying in all government institutions to find justice, and have yeasterday again come to me, asking for help. I can only do two things: write the whole story in foreign papers, or try again to make it known to the Emperor. I have chosen the latter, and have again written a letter to the Emperor, which I ask you to be so kind as to forward to him. I think every one of us ought to try to undeceive him, so I hope you will not be angry with me for my request.
I beg you to believe me, dear Sir, yours sincerely
Leo Tolstoy.
