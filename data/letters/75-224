Dear friend and sister, I am very glad to be put by your kind letter in personal intercourse with you. Though I can not agree with your belief in mediumship and occultism I greatly value your moral teaching and always with great interest read your journal[1] for which I heartily thank you. I find in it true and healthy spiritual food and very highly appreciate your activity.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
