* 305. Крауфорду (J. М. Crowford). Черновое.
D[ear] S[ir].
I am sorry to say that in our part of the country i. e. in some districts of Riazan and expecially Tula provin[c]es the crops are nearly as bad as last year and that I am obliged to continue our work in some villages for the next year which I will be able to do thanks to the sums that have been sent to me and have not been all spent this year. Therefore I can not refuse to employ money that will be sent to me as I did last year.
Милостивый государь.
