Dear Sir,
I thank you very much for the Vedic Magazine which you were so kind to send me. I am reading it always with great interest. In the last N[0] received by me — vol. III №4 — I appreciated very much the article «Plato and Shankaracharya» by Pandit Prabhu Dutt Shastri, М. А. В. T.
You would very kind if you consented to help me with a work that I have lately begun, and which, I hope can be of some interest to you. I have begun a serie of expositions of all the great religions of the world,[1] the essence of which is always one and the same for all. Naturally the Vedic religion, as one of the most ancient and profound, must take in these series the first place. I wish to make a selection of the most striking and profound sentences of the Vedic religion. If you, or some your contributors, can and will help me in this matter by corresponding with me on the subject, I will be very thankful.
With full esteem your friend,
Leo Tolstoy.
P. S. With the same mail I send you some of my books, which will, I hope, be of interest to you.

Милостивый государь,
С полным уважением ваш друг
Лев Толстой.
