Dear sir,
Mr. James Greelman an American gentleman, editor of the New York Herald will forward to you this note. I advised him to see you in St. Petersbourg hoping that you will not refuse to give him all kind of information that he may want about certain Russians affairs, that interest him and help him as a stranger in Petersbourg society which you know so well. In doing it you. will greatly oblige me.
Yours truly
L. Tolstoy.
23 March 1891.

Милостивый государь,
