Dear Mr. Thompson,
I was very glad to receive your letter and to know that you continue to work at your own spiritual life and try to help others in the same direction.
I have received the «Gospel of Buddha» which you sent me and thank you very much for it. I know the book before, but I am very glad to have it because I appreciate it very much.[1] I gave it to my daughter Alexandra to read, to whom it is new and to whom it will be profitable.
With many thanks for your kind letter, believe me, dear Mr. Thompson,
Leo Tolstoy.
I have [been] not so very ill as I was weak, and therefore asked my daughter to write this letter for you, but I will not send it without writing you that I remember with great pleasure your visit and our conversations and especially your modesty together with your spirituality.
With true brotherly love, yours L. Tolstoy.
1/14-th March 1907.
Toula, Jasnaja Poliana.
Дорогой г-н Томпсон,
Лев Толстой.
