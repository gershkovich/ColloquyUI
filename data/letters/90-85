In view of the mutilation which my novel «Resurrection» has undergone at the hands of the Editor of the «Cosmopolitan» in which its publication has been begun, this being utterly contrary to my clearly expressed desire conveyed to the Editor by my friend V. Tchertkoff through whom the MS was delivered, I find myself compelled to disown the authorship of the work as it has appeared on the pages of the «Cosmopolitan».
