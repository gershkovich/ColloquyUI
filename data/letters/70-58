My dear Crosby, I have received the extract of my book «Life»[1] and have found it very well done. I wrote to Mr. Hall that I liked his work and wished him success. It would be very well to write a preface to it, but I cannot do it now.[2]
I am always very glad to have news from you and to know that you are working for spreading the truth of non-resistance and wish you internal satisfaction from your work.
Your friend.
