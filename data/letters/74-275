Dear Sir,
I received your letter and your article in the Cooperative and thank you heartily for both, especially for the article which is splendid. It was a great joy to me to know that there are men in America who understand as well as you do the purport of the Douchobor’s work. It would not be otherwise in a country which gave to the world one of its greatest men, William Lloyd Garrison, who is not understood and appreciated at his whole worth and was and is not only an abolitionist of slavery in America, but a great prophet of mankind. I am glad to know that you are the grandson of a friend of this great man.[1]
I w’ill translate your article and publish it and send to Canada to the Doukhobors. It will do them good. They will understand through it in what lies their strength and in what their feebleness.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
