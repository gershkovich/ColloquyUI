* 8. Томасу Ферису и Берти [Бертраму?] Роу (Thomas Н. Ferris & Bertie [Bertram?] Rowe.)
Dear Mister Ferris & Rowe,
I still am very weak, but if I was quite strong and healthy, I could not wish to discuss the matter of your creed, because our intercourse can have no good results for you and for me. All what you write in your letter has been heard and read by me hundreds of times, and I was always astonished to see that good and religious people should prefer such strange, contrary to reason and complicate theories as yours[1] to the simple belief in God and man’s relation to him as his servant — a belief that gave and gives me in all circumstances of my life a perfect guide in my conduct and tranquility and gladness of heart in life and coming death. All, what I can say to you, is that being much older than you, I think myself obliged to advise you to try to liberate yourself from the noxeous delusion under which you are labouring.
Yours truly
Уважаемые гг. Ферис и Роу,
Искренно ваш
