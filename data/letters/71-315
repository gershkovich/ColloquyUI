Dear Crosby,
This letter will be given to you by my friend Volkenstein who is going to join his wife a political martyr at Sachaline.[1]
Please excuse me for not answering your last letter.[2] I did write a long answer[3] but did not send it because it was intended for your dinner and I could not refrain from expressing my opinion about the growing of American patriotism for which I am very very sorry, and I was afraid that this letter should be desagreable to your friends who are so well disposed to me. *
Yesterday I received the book «The soul of a people»[4] and thank you very much for sending it to me. I read the first chapter and think it very good. I am reading the Social Gospel and like very much your articles in it. You are touching in them always the true key-note. Wishing you to progress in the same direction I am yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
29 November 1898.
*The idea of this letter[5] is expressed in my article: The two wars,[6] which must appear one of these days and your opinion of which I am anxious to know.
Дорогой Кросби,
Лев Толстой.
