* 416. Крауфорду (J. М. Crowford). Черновое.
In answer to your letter I have the honour of informing you that this year the famine in one part of the country is not less severe than it was last [year] and that our work has been continued during this year, although not in the same measure as last. This year we have over 90 refectories (kitchens).
Our means are not so ample as they were last year. Moreover we have overreached our budget, — as the want of fire wood has been greater than we expected it. Therefore every gift from American benefactors for our famine stricken peasants will be gratefully accepted.
