Dear Sir, I never sell the right of translation of my books and everybody is welcome to translate and to publish them. I said only to Mr. Steveni,[1] who asked me, if your translation, which was to appear, was made from the Russian original, that I thought it was made from the French, because I sent the russian manucsript only to Mrs. Delano[2] in Boston. I am very glad to hear, that the translation has been made from the Russian and hope, that it will be very good.[3]
I have no reason nor right to excuse you of anything improper and am, dear Sir, writh true regard yours truly
L. Tolstoy.
