Dear Mr. Ferris,
When I wrote to you, that I did not wish to discuss your religious views, because no good results could come out of it, I thought very carefully over the matter. Your letter and your question confirm me in this resolution. I can not answer your question, because I can not understand it, though I see, that for you it has a very clear meaning. And therefore you see that our discussion would be quite vain. You say that my refusal to see you again is a sign of my want of love. My love to you can manifest itself only in repeating my advice and hearty wish that you should free your good and religious soul from the strange ideas that mar it, which as they say in a Russian popular asying: spoil by a spoonful of tar a barrel of honey.
So once more repeating my conviction of the needlessness of our interview, I wish you and your friend[1] a good journey home.
Yours truly Leo Tolstoy.
Уважаемый г. Ферис,
Искренно ваш Лев Толстой.
