* 110. Луизе Мерц (Louise Maertz). Черновое.
Dear Madame,
I received the check you sent me. A friend of mine is now in Samara helping the poor people with 1000 pounds sent to me by the Canadian Dookhobors.[1] He writes to me that the Red Cross has so well organised the feeding that there is no danger of famine for the children.
But there is great need of cattle, instruments and even clothes. My friend has decided to spend the money that is entrusted to him on those objects.
I agree with him on that point and if you have nothing against your money being spent in the same way, I will forward it to him.
I shall wait for your answer, and will send your to Samara only if I receive your consent; or on the opposite case will forward it back to you.
Милостивая государыня,
