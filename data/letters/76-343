Dear sir,
I quite agree with you about Shelley.[1] He has not given all what he could and certainly would have given to the world. He had the highest aspirations and was always bold and true.
I was glad to know that you agree with my opinion of the merit of Shakespeare’s work.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
