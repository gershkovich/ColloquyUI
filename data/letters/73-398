My dear Mr. Crosby,
I got your letter and also the book and pamphlets of Mr. Herbert Welsh and his letter.[1] I hope to be able to read his book and then to answer his very interesting letter. Your book has not yet reached me.[2] It will be a true pleasure to me to read it, as it is with all your books. Please excuse the briefness of my letter. I am very busy to day,[3] but don don’t wish to postpone my answer.
With true sympathy yours sincerely,
Leo Tolstoy.
14 December 1902.
Дорогой Кросби,
С искренней симпатией преданный вам
Лев Толстой.
