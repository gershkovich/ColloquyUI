Dear Miss,
To the two questions you put in your letter I can give you one answer for both. We can not live a reasonable life without an ideal of perfection before us. But we must know that the ideal of perfection can never be attained so that our aim is not to live up to it but only approach it as much as we can. The ideal of perfection in the sexual question is in my opinion complete chastity. But if a man or woman can not attain it the next approach to it is marriage in which again man and woman ought to try to be as chaste as possible and moreover accept as a sacred duty the bringing up and education of children which may be the result of marriage.
As to the providing for old age I think that the ideal of perfection of life is to live it only in the present moment, whilst all our cares for the future make us deviate from the true path.
Wishing you success in the life you have chosen I am dear Miss

Милая барышня,
Отвечать:
Запасать для старо[сти] не надо.
О полов[ом] вопросе, что чем больше воздерж[ания], тем лучше. Если же не в сил[ах], то не уклоняться от последствий выкармливания новор[ожденных] детей — великое дело воспитание дет[ей].
