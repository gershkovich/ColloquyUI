Dear friend,
I have got your letter and will answer it, each point separately.
1) I am very sorry that you have spent so much money for the translation of the four Gospels. 100 for a volume is very dear.[1]
2) I have not yet had time to look over the translations of «What I believe» and «While you have the light», but I will do so and, if they are not bad, will send you the authorisations. I think, that the «Kingdom of God» is one of my books, which will sell better, than others, and will bе very glad to know, that there is a cheap edition of it.[2]
3) I asked my friend Mr. Tchertkoff to send you a list of my writings since 1881, and he promised, that he will do it. His adress is: Russia, Government of Voronesh, station Rossosha. Vladimir Tshertkoff.
4) I would be very glad, if I could forward to you this year a new work, which should be edited by your company before any others. And hope to do so.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
30 August 1895.
Дорогой друг,
Искренно ваш Лев Толстой.
