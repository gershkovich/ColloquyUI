Isaak W. Heysinger.
Dear Sir,
I received your book and thank you for it. The translation seems to me to be very good, though I am not a competent judge of it. I have read many translations — French, German, Russian and English, and it seems to me that yours is one of the best. It produces the impression of profound wisdom which in its depth can not be quite clearly expressed.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.

Милостивый государь,
Искренне ваш
Лев Толстой.
