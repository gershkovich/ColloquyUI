* 443. А. Г. Холлистеру (A. G. Hollister).
Dear friend,
Last spring I was busy writing a book about marriage[1] and I got quite new views of the matter. At the same time I was reading the books I could get about communiti’s in America. I read Noyes[2] book and a book of a German[3] whose name I forgot. In those books I found quite new notions for me about the Shakers. At the same time I received a letter from a Shaker with books, treats and three photographs. I read the books and was very thankfull to the brother, [4] who sent me them, but infortunally I lost the letter with the address, so that I could not answer and thank him. Now I received your books, and treats and letter. I read it all and thank you for it. All this strengthens my vews on marriage, which I expose in my book that I am just now finishing. I think that the ideal of a christian always was and must be complete chastity and appreciate very much your books about that matter.
I know that you, shakers, speak always the truth and therefore expect the same from others. So I will tell you frankly all what I think of your religious views. I think that you profess the true christian religion and the true christian life, but you believe in two things in which I never can believe and you ought not: firstly, in the saintity of the whole Bible, including in it the old Testament, the Epistles and the Revelation of mother Ann,[5] and secondly that you believe in manifestation of spirits.
The true revelation of God is only in the words of Jesus which are recorded in the Evangeliums and those only can guide us. There are no other spirits than our spirit, which is always battling with matter. Spirit is only the opposit of matter and can manifest itself only in matter. All manifestations of spirits without matters are delusions.
Please do not deprive me of your love for my boldness; I very much appreciate your good disposition to me and love you.
Leo Tolstoy.
