Dear Sir,
I am very sorry, that I could not answer your letter before. I was very glad to receive it. The greatest joy of my life is to know, that there are in the world men like you, who feel and think in the same way as myself, especially when they are so straightforward and sincere as you are. I am sure that the farther you will go on the way, that you have chosen, the happier you will feel yourself. I say it by experience. Our life is so short and the power of mind and love, that we have, is so great, that it is not worth the while to live it in doing the wrong thing. If you will be so good to inform me of your doings, I will be thankfull.
With true love Yours truly Leo Tolstoy.
Give my love, if you see him, to Mr. Kenworthy.[1] It is a long time that I had no news from him and of his work.
4 January 1895.
Милостивый государь,
