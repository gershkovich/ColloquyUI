Dear Sir,
I have received your book[1] and have read it with great interest and pleasure. The whole book is penetrated by a true christian spirit which incite to action and not to submission, or adaptation to the existing state of things.
I was happy to read the good tidings in your letter, the more so that we see the same events in Russia and Germany and especially in Austria, I think, that indeed the kingdom of God is at hand. Are you acquainted with a German periodical edition in BuddaPest under the title «Religion des Geistes», by Eugene Schmitt. I think it should be good, if you were in communication with him. Although your book is dedicated to your grandson, I suppose you are yet a young man and therefore heartily wish you may still work for a long time in the same direction where you are now progressing, and may you experience more and more joy in the conviction, that you are fulfilling the will of him, who sent you here.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
10 September 1895.
Милостивый государь,
Искренно ваш
