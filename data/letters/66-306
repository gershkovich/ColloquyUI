306. И.-Ф. Гапгуд (I. F. Hapgood).
Dear Miss Hapgood,
I received your last letter with the draft for five pounds 18S. and thank you heartily for the trouble you took in this matter and also the generous contributors. I received also your translation of my article about our work[1] and admired the correctness and elegance of your translation. I am sorry to say that the crops in our place are nearly as bad as they were last year ant that I am obliged to continue [the] part of my work next year. I have some money left so that I will be able to do it thanks to your kindness and the goodness of your compatriots.
My compliment to your mother
Yours truly
L. Tolstoy.
Дорогая мисс Гапгуд,
Ваш
Л. Толстой.
