Dear Sir,
I received your new book[1] and have read part of it with great interest. I think it would be good to translate it in Russian, and I will try to do it if you have nothing against it. I am quite ignorant about J. Thomas[2] and his work and would be very glad to know it. I would rather not abuse of your kindness and will ask my friends to send me those books. I am very glad to know that you are interested in religious matter. It forms a new link between you and me.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
13 July 1904.
Милостивый государь,
Искренно ваш
Лев Толстой.
