Dear Sir,
I have received your letter and the Labour Annual. Thank you for sending it. I have looked it over and have found in it many things, that are new to me. I think, that such a book is very useful, because it makes known to each other people working the same work and not knowing their comrades.
I think, that the title of your publication is too narrow. The contents are broader. It contains not only records of the labour movement, but of the whole social reformation movement, which is going on now with so great intensity in the whole world.
The solution of the labour question will not solve the social question, but the social question includes the labour question.
And the social question can be solved only by the annulment of every kind of restraint used by one man or reunion of men over any other man or men. And this can only be done by change of public opinion. The social question will be solved only when it will be regarded by the great majority of men as base, shameful, abject and revilling a man to a beast to use violence against every other man, as to be a thief or murderer. And this opinion is more and more going to be general, and to establish this public opinion is what I have worked for with all my strength and will work for to my last day.
I will beg my daughter to put my photo in this letter if she has one.
Wishing you succes in your and our common work, I remain
yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.

Милостивый государь,
искренно ваш
