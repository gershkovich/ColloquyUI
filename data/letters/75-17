Dear Mr. Bryan,
The receipt of your letter gave me great pleasure as well as the reminiscence of your visit. If you wish to have Bondareff’s book and my letter to politicians[1] please write to my friend Wladimir Tchertkoff, England, Hants, Christchurch, he will forward to you all, what you wish to have. I had in the Russian papers news about you. I wish with all my heart success in your endeavor to destroy the trusts and to help the working people to enjoy the hole fruits of their toil, but I think that this is not the most important thing of your life. The most important thing is to know the will of God, concerning one’s life, i. e. to know what he wishes us to do and to fulfill it. I think that you are doing it and that is the thing in which I wish to you the greatest success.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
2 February 1904.
Дорогой г. Брайан,
