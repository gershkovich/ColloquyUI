29 January (10 February) 1892.
In reply to your letter of to-day I can only express my astonishment of the contents of the telegram which you have received from the «Daily Telegraph». I have never denied or outhorised anyone to deny the authenticity of the articles on the Famine which appeared under my name in the «Daily Telegraph». I know that thes articles are the translation of the paper which I wrote for the Review: «Questions of Philosophy and Psychology» on the Famine and forwarded to you for translation into English.
I can only explain the telegram you have received by a letter written by my wife to the «Moskovski Vedomosti» denying the assertion that I had send any articles to any foreing periodical and repudiating certain extracts from the «Daily Telegraph» affirming with reason that they were garbled till they had become almost unrecognisable.[2]
I deeply regret the annoyance caused you by my article.
Pray accept the assurance of my perfect esteem.
Yours truly,
Leo Tolstoy.
Искренно ваш
Лев Толстой.
