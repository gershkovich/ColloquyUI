Dear Sir!
I got your letter only yesterday and am afraid that you will not receive my reply before you start from America. We are heartily thankful to your people for their offerning and for the sentiments, which prompted them to make it. I hope to see you in Russia and then I will be very happy to give all the informations I am able to give about the places where the flour should be directed and where it should be used to the best advantage of the famine stricken population.
With kind regards I am, dear Sir, yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
Милостивый государь!
