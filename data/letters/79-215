Dear Sir,
I received in due time the translation of Leonid Andreev's book[1] and thank you much for it, as well as for the dedication.
As to the «Cycle of reading» — it did not reach me, of which I am very sorry. Of all my books I think that is the one that is the most usefull, and I would be most glad to see it translated.
Yours truly Leo Tolstoy.
May 3/18[2] 1909. Iassenky.
Милостивый государь,
Уважающий вас Лев Толстой.
