Dear Sir, — I have only just finished the two books,[1] that you have sent me, and wish to express to you my gratitude for the books and their contents.
I cannot express to you the joy that I experience in seeing a man of your ability and sincerity working at the same work in which I have put my life — and not because I choosed this vocation, but because it is sole work in this our life, that is worth to work for.
I guess that you are in the same position, and I think that our task is to let people feel that in this life they have nothing else to do — as to help in the establishment of the kingdom of God, which cannot be established otherwise, than by establishing it in our own hearts by trying to be as perfect as is our Father in heaven.
Tell me please, if you have many co-workers. Is the religious feeling alive in the English workmen? Is it not stifled by socialistic doctrines? I like very much the difference, that you establish between Socialism ans Christianity. We cannot too much insist upon it. Christianity for to be powerful must be pure from all mélange of Dogmatism, Sentimentalism, Evangelism, as well as of Socialism, Anarchy, or Philanthropism.
Excuse my bad English, and believe me,
Yours with hearty sympathy,
Leo Tolstoy.
Лев Толстой.
