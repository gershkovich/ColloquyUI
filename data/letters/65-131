Dear Sir,
I have tried to answer your question in the epilogue to the Kreutzer Sonata. You ask if I mean that sexual intercourse should not be indulged at all. I answer: yes. Every man and woman ought to know and to believe that it would be better for him or for her to be completely chaste (in marriage or out of it) and to have no sexual intercourse at all. But if you ask what will be the consequences of such a belief (if such belief should become common to all, which cannot be before many and many centuries). I will answer you that I don’t know and don’t wish to know, because it is no business of mine: what I know is that for my soul and for everybody’s soul it will always be better to be chaste, than to indulge in sexual love. And this I know perfectly in my conscience, and you know the same, and this is business of mine, because it concerns my soul of which I have the charge. (You must excuse my bad English and try to understand what I mean). Judging by your letter you are in earnest about moral questions, i.e. conduct, and therefore I am sure that you will find the right way in this question as in others.
Yours truly.
Милостивый государь,
Искренно ваш.
