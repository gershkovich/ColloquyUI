Dear Sir,
The man who will give you this letter is a peasant from Samara a Malakan. I think you know that this is the denomination that they give in Russia to dissenters of a evangelistical creed. Last april the <Ispravnik> Stanovoi came in his house and took from him his three children. They did the same in three familys of Malakan. They came to me asking for help. I could not refuse them all what I could do and I wrote a letter to the Emperor relating in it this story and all what <is done this last time to the dis> I know about the persecutions of the dissenters <going on the lan> in Russia. I hope that the Emperor will not be offended by my letter. I tried to express my ideas as meekly as I could. You can read the letter, it is open. The favour I am asking of you is to forward this letter to the Emperor <and to dispose him to listen, to speak to him in favour of on this matter and to dispose him favourably to this man of these men. It will be really a good action of your part if you> Please do it <and excuse mo for the disturbance that this can> It will be a really good action.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
