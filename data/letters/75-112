Dear friend,
I was glad to have news from you, but am sorry not to be able to give any article to Mr. Wheeler.[1] I am anxious to finish the writings that I have began[2] and have no leisure to write something else. I thank you for sending me «The Whim».[3] I am glad to find there your verses. I have taken lately one of your verses as an epigraph to my article[4] on this abominable war which I have already sent to Tchertkoff.
Your friend Leo Tolstoy.
Дорогой друг,
Ваш друг Лев Толстой.
