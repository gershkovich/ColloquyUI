Dear Sir,
I received the two first number of your magazine.[1] I think it is very good. The aim of your work, as you put it in your letter, is the highest that can be pursued by man's activity. The two articles «Ourselves» and «The Basis of Life» quite correspond to it.
I am very much interested in Indian philosophy and the religions teaching of your great teachers.
The more place you shall give in your magazine to the idea of those men, the more interesting it will be for the western readers.
Thanking you for your magazine and letter, I remain, dear Sir, yours truly,
Leo Tolstoy.
17/30 May 1907.
Toula, Russia.
Милостивый государь,
Лев Толстой.
