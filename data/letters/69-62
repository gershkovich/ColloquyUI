Dear Sir,
The reception of your letter gave me a great joy, for it is a long time, that I know you and love you. Though the paths we go by are different, I do not think, that we differ in the foundation of our thoughts.
I was very glad to see you mention twice in your letter the life to come.
There is nothing, that widens so much the horizon, that gives such a firm support or such a clear view of things, as the consciousness, that allthough it is but in this life, that we have the possibility and the duty to act, nevertheless this is not the whole of life, but that bit of it only, which is open to our understanding.
I shall wait with great impatience for the appearance of your new book, which will contain the so much needed criticism of the orthodox political economy.[1] The reading of every one of your books makes clear to me things, which were not so before, and confirms me more and more in the truth on practicability of your system. Still more do I rejoice at the thought, that Imay possibly see you.[2]
My summer I invariably spend in the country near Tula.
With sincere affection
I am truly your friend
Leon Tolstoy.

Dear Sir,
С истинной любовью
ваш друг
