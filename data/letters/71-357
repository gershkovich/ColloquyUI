Dear Mr. Stead.
Please write to V. Tchertkoff (Purleigh, Essex) and ask him if he has something of my writings that can be published in your paper. I should be very glad if I could contribute in your efforts.
I am very sorry that you did not come to Jasnaia Poliana when you were in Russia.[1] Please pardon me that I did not answer your letter. I expected to have time to do it and at last I was too late.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
Дорогой г. Стад,
Преданный вам
Лев Толстой.
