Dear Sir,
I received your letter and the parcel with different papers. I am very much gratified to know that your opinion on Shakespeare and his fame quite coincide with mine.[1] I looked through the papers that you sent me and am sorry not to have found there the first volume of your book.[2]
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
2 Dec.
1906.
Милостивый государь,
Преданный вам
Лев Толстой.
