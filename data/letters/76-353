То the odd man of the Crank.
Dear sir,
I thank you very much for the Crank Magazine, which I enjoy very much. To-day I have read the last article of Worland:[1] «The earth for all»,[2] it is very good, especially his criticism of Malthus’s theory,[3] which notwithstanding its weakness has had such a large spreading. I think that true Christianity with its ideal of chastity is the best remedy of the imaginary future excess of the population. I will take care that it should be translated in russian, if he will allow it. I liked it very much, also your answer to Schaw,[4] as I like all the pages signed by «Odd Man». I would be very glad to know your name and be in direct intercourse with you.
Have you many subscribers to your magazine? I wish the greatest success to your work, so very necessary in our time.
Yours truly Leo Tolstoy.
P. S. Reading your very good note to the word «anarchism» I remembered on the same matter the saying of Lao-Tze; he says: when great sages have power over the people, the people do not notice them, if the power is in the hands of sages (not great ones), the people like them and praise them: if those who govern are less sage the people are afraid of them and where those who govern are still less sage, the people despise them.
L. Tolstoy.
