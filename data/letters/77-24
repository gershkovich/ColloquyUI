Dear Sir,
The death of Ernest Crosby is a very great sorrow for me. I realized the strength of my inner spiritual connection with him only when I got the news of his death.
It is a great and very rare happiness to possess such a friend, of whom one can be sure that he understands you fully and whose leading innermost force of life is quite the same as your own. And excepting his great intelligence, talent and high morality, — such a man was Ernest Crosby for me.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.

Милостивый государь,
Искренне ваш
Лев Толстой.
