Dear Mr. Crosby.
I received both your letters as well as the volume of Mr. Trevors newspaper[1] and thank you very much for sending it to me. I found in the volume many interesting articles, one of those is about Thoreau[2] by Trevor and another a beautiful sermon on the text of James’ epistle.[3] I wish success to Mr. Trevor in his work and think, that he has no reason to be despondent, because he has so many coworkers over the world, and the noble work, at which he is working, is the unique real human work of our time.
I am very glad to know that you have taken the side of the working men and expect to hear about you as a champion of the good cause.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
2/14 September 1894.
Дорогой г. Кросби.
