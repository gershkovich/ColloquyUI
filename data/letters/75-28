Dear Mr. Payne,
I think that the answer to your questions can be found only in your own conscience. I have tried to indicate the principles which I think ought to guide the life of a christian. The application of these principles to life depend from the strength of one’s temptations and belief in the truth.
I hope you will persevere in the path you have chosen and with all my heart wish you success in it.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
Jan. 21 1904.
Дорогой г. Пэйн,
Искренно ваш
Лев Толстой.
