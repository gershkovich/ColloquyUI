Dear friend,
I have been very glad to get your letter and to be informed that by the publication of my book[1] I have got brothers in America.
I have been lately asking the same question that you put to me of Mr. Garrison,[2] who has sent to me the life of his father.[3] Namely I have been asking if there are many persons in America who confess the true Christian religion, which has been exposed in the declaration of non-resistance. In answer to your question I can state to you that there are 30 or 40 persons known to me who confess with me the Christian principles, exposed in my book and that with every year and month their number increases. We are not organized in a church and never will be. I think that the sole means to get in a true church is not to organize churches or communities, but to seek only after the Kingdom of God and its truth. We will meet there from all parts of the world, and from all different nations and religious confessions if only we are true seekers of the truth.
I shall expect your promised information and be very thankful for it.
Leo Tolstoy.
Дорогой друг,
