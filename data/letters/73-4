Dear Sir,
I was not well when I asked my friend to write to you. Now I am better and am very glad to be able to add a few words with my thanks for your books.[1]
They are both very nice and the idea to pu[blish] the new testament before the old is very good.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
Милостивый государь,
И скренне ваш
Лев Толстой.
