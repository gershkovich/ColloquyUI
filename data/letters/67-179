Dear Sir,
I got your two books and thank you heartily for them. It is the greatest joy of my life to know persons such as you and to see, that the ideas, which I live for, are likewise the mainspring of life unto others and are expressed in such beautiful and vigourous style, as I had occasion to notice in your two books.
Both your books are remarkably good and I cannot give preference to either of them. In the «Old order and the New» the Christian truth serves to corroborate the truth of the Socialistic tendencies; whereas in the «Gospel of the Poor» it is the Socialistic, Communistic and Anarchistic theories that serve to corroborate the Christian truth, which occupies the most prominent part.
Though while there is a censorship in Russia, the publishing of these books is out of the question, yet I shall get some of my friends to translate them, and will then spread them.
The ennemies of the Kingdom of God have but one means left them it is to hush up the truth and make believe, they neither hear nor comprehend it — the fact of which was so strikingly acknowleged by the French, when they prohibited to publish the processes of the anarchists.
It follows then, that the chief struggle, which lies before a labourer of the Kingdom of God, is to frustrate this plot of nonbelieving and non-hearing of what is seen and heard of all.
I, therefore, wish you, as a strong and active labourer, the greatest possible amount of spiritual energy and entire success in it.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
Милостивый государь,
Преданный вам
Лев Толстой.
