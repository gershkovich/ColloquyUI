Dear Mr. Cockerell,
Please excuse me for not having answered your letter and thanked you for the Ruskin’s books.[1] Now I have received the Mufti’s letter and am very obliged to you for forwarding it to me. The Mufti’s letter is so orientally laudatory that I find it [is] difficult to answer it. But I will try to do it and am very glad to communicate with such an interesting personality.
Yours truly
Дорогой г. Кокрелль,
Искренно ваш
Лев Толстой.
