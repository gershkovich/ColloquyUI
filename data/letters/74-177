Dear Sir,
I received your books and thank you for them.[1]
As regards the most complete and best edition of my works I have no opinion about it because I have not seen any of them.
It is quite indif[f]erent to me on which to inscribe my name, and I will do it on any you send me.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
1903. 16 Juny.
Милостивый государь,
Искренно ваш
Лев Толстой.
