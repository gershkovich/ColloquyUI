Dear Sir,
I received your book «The Next Step in Evolution» and have read it with great pleasure. The idea of joining thе scientific truth of evolution with the religious one of the second advent is very good and rich in application. Thank you heartily for sending me the book.
Yours truly Leo Tolstoy.
P. S. I do not write myself, because I have been ill and am still very weak.

Милостивый государь,
Искренно ваш Лев Толстой.
