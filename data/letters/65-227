Dear Friend and Brother. I received your long letter and have read it with interest, but I must confess that all your arguments taken from John's revelation do not convince me. I do not consider that book as a moral guide. I think that God’s revelation must be simple and able to be understood by the simplest soul. In general as I told you before, dear friend, I agree completely with your practice of life, but not with your theory, especially about spirits. — I hope that the open expression of my thoughts will not lessen your kind disposition to me.
With brotherly love yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
