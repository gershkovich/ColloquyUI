Dear Sir,
I will not judge the conduct of the unlucky woman, of whom you write. It is said: do not judge for not to be judged yourself. But I say only, that in all my writings there can not be a line which justifies such conduct. I profess the сhristian doctrine, the first principle of which is the sacrifice of our pleasure and happiness to the wellbeing of our neighbour. In this case it is quite the opposite. This woman has sacrificed thе pеace and happiness not only of her husband and her father in law, but especially of her children, the eldest of which must dreadfully suffer and will suffer all his life for the shame of his mother, has sacrificed it all for the pleasure of being united without obstacles with the charming Mr. Giron. That is my opinion of this dirty story, which contrary to reason occupies the whole world.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
Милостивый государь,
Искренно ваш
