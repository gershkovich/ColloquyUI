My dear Friend,
Sympathising with all my heart with the aims of your Brotherhood Publishing С°, I intend to put at your disposition the first translation of all my writings as yet unpublished, as well as forthcoming. Should you find it in any way expedient, as for instance in order to secure for them a wider circulation, to offer the first publication of any of my works to one of the English periodical papers or magazines, and should any pecuniary profit therefrom ensue, I would desire it to be devoted to the work of your Brotherhood Publishing Company.
As for the further right of publishing my works (i. e. after this the first appearance in English, which I intend placing at your disposal), they are to become public property in accordance with a statement I have formerly made public and now desire to confirm. —
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
Moscow, 4 Feb. 1896.
