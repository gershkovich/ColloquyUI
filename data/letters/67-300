Dear Sir.
You are quite right in working, as you work as teacher, and I am sure, that you do a great deal of qood to your pupils. We can not change at our will the conditions of our life, but we can profess the truth, though even it were to condemn us. And that is what yon do; therefore I was glad to get your letter and I also love you.
Leo Tolstoy.
22 December 1894.
