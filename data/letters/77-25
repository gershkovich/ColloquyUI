Mr. Benedict Prieth.
Dear Sir,
I delayed my answer to your letter because of illness. I knew the sad news of Ernest Crosby’s death before, but nevertheless I thank you for your letter.
Though a sad one, it is a satisfaction to see a true appreciation of the rare qualities and high character of one's best friends.
What you say of him, that he never said an evil word of anyone, is one of the greatest commendations that can be said of any man. I hope that E. Crosby could not estimate me more than I loved and estimated him.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
