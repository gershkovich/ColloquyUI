Dear Crosby,
I have written long ago a preface to your article on Shakespeare which has grown in a whole book.[1] I think that I will publish it when it is translated.[2] So that it will answer your wishes.
The crimes and cruelties which are commited in Russia are dreadful, but I am firmly convinced that this revolution will have greater and more beneficient results for humanity than the great French revolution had.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
1905, 19 July.
Дорогой Кросби,
Искренно ваш Лев Толстой.
