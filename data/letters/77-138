Dear Sir,
The statement that you attribute to me is quite right in its meaning although I do not remember where I have expressed it.[1]
What belongs the two so called fathers of this very hateful and disgusting child the Russian revolution — Tchaykovsky[2] and Aladin,[3] I have no idea of Mr. Aladin. Tchaykovsky I know by our mutual friend[4] as a very good, upright and sincere man.
Thanking you for the pamphlet on Ernest Crosby,[5] whom I very much regret and whose memory is very dear te me,
I remain, dear Sir, yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
1/14 June 1907.
Toula, Russia.
Милостивый государь,
Лев Толстой.
