* 257. Иосио Сугимото (Ioshio Sugimoto). Черновое.
Dear Sir,
I am sorry to hear that you are [a] soldier. The business and duty of a soldier is to prepare to kill other men. Killing not only men, but animals is very bad.
Everybody must try to look at every man as a brother and to love him, and not prepare to kill his brother.
I am sending to you one of my books. I hope and wish that you will like it.
2/IV —15/IV 1910.
Милостивый Государь,
