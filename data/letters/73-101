Dear Sir.
I have received your letter and your sermon on my excommunication, as well as your books for which I thank you.
I was very glad to know that I had co-religionists of which I did not know anything till now. I knew about the Unitarien but not about the Theistic Church. I have read some of the books and leaflets that you sent me to see that your belief is nearly the same as mine. I say nearly, because I do not regard Christ as an impostor as one of your co-religionists wrote to me some time ago[1] and do not lay at his door all the bad things that are included in the Gospel.
All that I read in your books is quite congenial to me and especially your sermon on «The Philosophy of Human life».
I am very sorry not to be able to send you my complete answer to the «Excommunication», but I wrote to my friend in England — V. Tchertkoff (Christchurch, Hants) begging him to send to you this answer and also some of my books on religious subjects by which you will see that without knowing each other personally we come to the same conclusions because we draw from the same source: human reason, love and conscience, as you rightly put in some of your books.
With respect and love
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
Милостивый государь,
С уважением и любовью
искренно ваш
