Dear Sir,
The whole matter concerning the publication of my novel has been entirely trusted to my respected friend V. Tchertkoff. I therefore know little, or scarcely anything about the details of this affair.
As to the drawbacks in publication which you mention in the statement of your serial, they have been caused, I presume, firstly: by the difficulty in forwarding the manuscripts to several translators for a simultaneous publication, and secondly: by the fact that before sending the manuscript, I reviewed every chapter which was the chief reason of the delay. So, the chief cause of all this misunderstanding may be attributed to me, or to the difficulty of this new transaction; but by no means to my respected friend Mr. Tchertkoff who, in spite of his complicated occupations, desinterestedly and with self-denial undertook the difficult task of procuring the money necessary for the help of the Russian exilers who were in great want and suffering, and for whom it was intended.
Anyhow, I greatly regret the annoyance which all this affair has caused you.
I think the money shall have been returned by this time; in any case, by this same post I write about it to Mr. Tchertkoff.
