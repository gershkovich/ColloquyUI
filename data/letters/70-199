Dear Friend,
Thank you sincerely for your kind letter with good wishes for my persecuted friends and myself.
As to the question you put to me I can add very little to the subject to what is stated in the book you vahe read. You are right in coming to the conclusion that we do not attach importance to dogmas such as the Evangelical conception of Atonement. But I think there is no need to be anxious on that account for such people as the Spirit Wrestlers.
However different be our individual relation to such metaphysical conceptions as this one of the Atonement we cannot but agree that God is Love and Justice and that therefore if those who are trying to serve Him sincerely and to the best of their ability are not all able to understand such abstract questions alike, he cannot demand of them faith in that which they are not able to accept. Sincerity is enough for God. And the facts, you have become acquainted with in this book are, I think sufficient for dispelling any doubt as to the sincerity and faithfulness before their God of these people who are sacrificing their lives for what they believe to be His will.
I think we would be discrediting our common God if we were each of us to attribute to Him insistance upon those theological tenets in which we differ between ourselves owing to our human limitations. Let us, while adhering, each one of us to the light wе have, be sufficiently tolerant and broad minded towards each others, to have confidence both in each others conscientiousness and in God’s power to enlighten and correct those deficiencies in faith we think we remark in one another.
With fraternal good wishes, I am
Yours faithfully.
