Dear Sir,
I received your letter and a copy of «From the City to the soil».[1] I am very much astonished to find that an American, discussing the land question, does not make any allusions to Henry George[2] and his great theory, which alone solves completely the land question.
Yours truly,
Leo Tolstoy.
May 18[th] 1909.
