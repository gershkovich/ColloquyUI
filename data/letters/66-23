* 23. Лоренсу Гронлунду (Laurence Gronlund). Черновое.
Dear Sir.
I received your book «Our Destiny»[1] several months ago and would have thanked you for it if I knew your adress. I read it through with more than great interest. I quite agree with your two main points: 1-mo that morality must be the basis of progress and 2-o that morality is true only when it is an effort to promote organic unity of society as you term it — to establish the kingdom of God on earth as I express the same thing.
The book made such a impression on me that I wished it to be translated in Russian and sent it to a friend of mine[2] for that purpose. I quite endorse the opinion of the Revue d’Economie politique,[3] that it is a quite new and more élevé aspect of socialism.
If my opinion of your book can be of any use to you I quite conscientiously say that I highly apreciate your book, the ideas exposed in it and the expression of them
Yours truly L. Tolstoy.
Милостивый государь.
Преданный вам Л. Толстой.
