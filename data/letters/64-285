* 285. А. Стокгэм (A. Stockham).
Dear Madam.
I have received your book «Tokology» and thank you very much for sending it to me. I have examined it and found that it is, as far as I am competent, truly a book, not only for woman but for mankind. Without labour in this direction mankind cannot go forward; and it seems to me especially in the matter treated in your book in chapter XI, we are very much behindhand. It is strange, that last week I have written a long letter to one of my friends[1] on the same subject. That sexual relation without the wish and possibility of having children is worse than prostitution and onanism, and in fact is both. I say it is worse, because a person who commits these crimes, not being married, is always conscious of doing wrong, but a husband and a wife, which commit the same sin, think that they are quite righteous.
Therefore your book (not speaking of its great merits) was very welcome to me.
I should very much like to have your book sold in M[oscow] and P[etersburg].
L. T.
