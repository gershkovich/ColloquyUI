Toula.
Dear friend and brother,
I received your letter and thank you very much for your proposition. I send your letter to England to the commitee which is established there for the emigration of the «Spirit Wrestlers». Will you be so kind as to write there (V. Tchertkoff, Millhouse Purleigh Essex, England). I am not clear on what conditions can the «Sp[irit] Wr[estlers]» have the land. Please give me and the Commitee informations.
With brotherly love
yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
11 July 1898.
