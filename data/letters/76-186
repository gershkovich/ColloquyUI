Dear friend,
I am sorry that I gave you so much trouble with the Independent.[1] Let him alone. I regret that I have written to you about this matter. I have received your «Garrison».[2] I like it. Lately his son[3] wrote to me that he thinks that [the greatest thing that] his father accomplisched was his proclamation of Non resistance.[4] I was very glad to hear it. Your «Tolstoy as schoolmaster»[5] has been translated in Russian which is a proof that it is good.
I think that though your lecturing may be very useful, your energy can be better employed in bookwriting; I read always with great pleasure your articles in the Crank,[6] a very good publication.
I am sorry for the Americans, not for Adin Balou,[7] that his name and work are unknown to them.
Do not wait to come to Russia till our revolution is settled. It will not be so soon. As to the disturbances that are going on now, they are only the precursors of the great revolution, which I hope will begin at once everywhere and will consist in the annihilation of state power.
You are still a young man and can have the opportunity to see the great change. Not so I. Therefore the sooner you come the more chances I will have to see you again before my great voyage.
Your friend
Leo Tolstoy.
