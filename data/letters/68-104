Dear Mr. Herron,
I had in my hands one of your books, but I had not time to read it, so that I knew before you wrote to me your name and your work, and greatly sympathised with it, that is with your work.
I thank you heartily for the books that you sent to me. I received them to day and will begin with the Christian state and hope that I will be induced to read them all. I have finished the first. I will write to you my genuine opinion of it.[1]
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
Дорогой г. Херрон,
Уважающий вас Лев Толстой.
