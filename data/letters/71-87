Dear Sir,
I duly received your letters and thank you for your good advice. I am the more disposed to follow it for the reason that the Douchoborys are just now in a very difficult position. They are persecuted where they live in the most dreadful manner; so that in those last two years they have lost the greatest part of their fortune and a part of them, more than 400 families lost 25% of their number from need and maladies, and now they are allowed to emigrate which they cannot do without help from outside.
I have written about it in russian papers but am afraid that the russian censure will not allow it to appear and have also sent an appeal to the English and American society — to my friends in Essex (V. Tchertkoff, Maldon), asking them to translate my letter and send it to the Times and New York Herald. I do not think it necessary to make a special appeal to the Quakers because this appeal is included in the one adressed to all Englishmen, but if you think it necessary I will do it.
Yours affectionally
Leo Tolstoy.
2 April 1898.
Милостивый государь,
Любящий вас
Лев Толстой.
