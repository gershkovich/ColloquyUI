Dear sir,
The letter that you received was adressed to Mr Haig the doctor.[1] I send you the copy of the letter adressed to you.[2] Please excuse me.
Please, if you write to the Hunters[3] to congratulate them from me and to say that I remember with great pleasure their visit.
What are they doing?
Yours truly
