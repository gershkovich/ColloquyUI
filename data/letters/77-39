Dear Mrs. Daniel,
I did not answer your letter before because I was ill and am not quite well till now. I am glad to hear that you intend to work at your article on land. Though it is very good as it is, it can only gain by it.[1]I appreciate also very much your idea of the connection of the three principles: of poverty, continence (as a degree of chastity) and of obedience to natural law. And I think and hope that you will express those ideas as strongly as all the articles of Worland and as simply and shortly as you say you wish to do it. The sole advice that I should wish to give you is to avoid polemic as much as possible.
I have received also a letter from your husband[2]. I hope he will excuse me if I do not write to him separately and am asking you to be so kind say to him:
1) That although I like very much the Crank, I quite agree with him that it would de very good not only to combine gardening and agricultural work with writing, but to put the foundation of your life in manual work and keep publishing work as an accessory. Then he will not be afraid to be too successful.
2) That I hope I will send for the Crank something which should be worthy of it and 3) that I will be very glad to know his questions and answer them if I feel myself able to do it.
With best wishes for you and your husband,
your friend L. Tolstoy.
2/15 February 1907.
Дорогая г-жа Дэниель,
ваш друг Л. Толстой.
