Dear friend,
I thank you heartily for sending me your writings[1] and especially for your kind letter.
I can say quite sincerely that I never forgot and never will the gladness that I felt in knowing you and your work and the joy that I got from my communion with you.[2] I can not help saying that I am sorry for the importance that you attach to spiritism. Your true and pure Christian faith and life are much more reliable than all that the spirits can say to you.
Your true friend
Leo Tolstoy.

Дорогой друг.
