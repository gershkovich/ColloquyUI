Dear Sir,
I received yesterday your letter with the pamphlets and thank heartily for sending them to me. It is one of the greatest joy’s of this life for me to know that thes ame god’s work, that I am trying to do, is done by so many others. I firmly believe, that the time, when Christ’s teaching will become not only a teaching, but a reality, is very near and your writing and acting strengthen this belief».
With brotherly love, yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
5 March 1894.
I would be very thankful, if you should give me some particulars of your biography.
Милостивый государь,
Лев Толстой.
