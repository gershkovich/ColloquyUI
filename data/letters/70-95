* 95. К. О. Хису (Charles Heath). Недоставленное.
Dear Sir,
This letter is the second letter that I am writing to you about the same matter. The reason why my first letter did not reach you will be explained to you by my friend Mr. Boulanger who will call on you. He will explain to you the matter in question and what is the favour that I am asking you. If you will agree with my request I think that you will do a very good action and render a service to the Emperor. If not, please excuse me for the trouble I give you and receive the assurance of my best regards.
