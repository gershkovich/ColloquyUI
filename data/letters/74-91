My dear Crosby,
It is a real pleasure to me to see your handwriting because I like you personally and all what I hear of you and from you is always agreable.
From timе to time I soo articles from you or about you and am very glad to see that you are a very steady and strong coworker in the establishment of the Kingdom of God. I would like very much [to] be able to write a book about education but I am sure I will not have time for it. Beside[s] many other writings that I am working at I am very interested now at a philosophical and religious definition of life[1] in which, à tort ou à raiscn,[2] I believe that I can say something quite new and very important for our time.
Thank you for your letter; please do not cease to inform me from time to time of your work and yourself.
Your friend Leo Tolstoy.
1903. 3 April.
Дорогой Кросби,
Ваш друг Лев Толстой.
