Dear friend and brother, I seldom experienced such true and great pleasure as I experienced at the reading of your truly brotherly and Christian letter. I thank you very much for the books and tracts that you sent me.[1] I received them safely and have read with great pleasure and profit some of them. The non-resistant catechism I have translated and will circulate it among our friends. It is remarkably well put in such a compacte, form the chief truths of our faith. What are your relations to the declaration of sentiments of the non-resistance society started by Garrison?[2] Were you a member of it at the time? I quite agree with you that Christianity will never enter its promised land till the divine truth of the non-resistance principle shall be recognized, but not the nominal church will recognize it. I am fully convinced that the churches are and have always been the worst enemies of Christ’s work. They have always led humanity not in the way of Christ, but out of it. I think that all we can say and wish about church is to try to be a member of Christ’s church, but we never can define the church itself, its limits, and affirm, that we are members of the sole, true church.
With true brotherly love and highest respect, I remain your friend and brother
