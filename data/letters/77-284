Dear Sir,
I just received your letter and your book «The sayings of Muhammad».[1]
I thank you heartily for both. I looked through the book and will use it for a second edition of my book «For every day» in which I have put many very profound and religious sayings of your Prophet.
If you wish to translate some of my books, I would like to advise you to translate my book «The Christian Teaching» or «On life» or «The Kingdom of God is within you». In any case if you like to have any biographical datas on me, I think the best thing you can do is to adress my friend V. Tchertkoff, Christchurch, England, who is the editor of all my works in English. I am sure he will give you all the help that he can. I send you herewith my photograph.
Yours truly Leo Tolstoy.
22 Nov. 1907.
I will write to day to my friend Tchertkoff asking to send you all you want.[2]
Милостивый государь,
Искренне ваш Лев Толстой.
Л. Т.
