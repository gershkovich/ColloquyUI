Dear friend,
I have received your very remarkable letter and your book «The son of man».[1] I have read it with the same feeling with which I read all your books — the feeling that it is just what I would have said on the same matter but better and more energetically said. Your opinion of our Duma is, I regret to say, quite true. I hope that the fallacy of all this thing will be soon clear to everybody and we, Russians, will go on [an] other road.
With best wishes, yours truly,
Leo Tolstoy.
10 July 1906.
Дорогой друг,
Лев Толстой.
