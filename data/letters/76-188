Dear friend,
I was very glad to receive news from you. I opened the book of Blair[1] in the middle and read it to the end. It is very good and is a dreadful document of our life. It is a very strong illustration to the other book,[2] which I looked only over, but will read attentively. The conclusion and what I saw of it seems to me to be very good.
I saw some time ago your name and article in a paper and in the «Crank»,[3] which I like very much and will read with great interest your book[4] and am sure to endorse all your ideas, because your conception of life and mine have the same source.
