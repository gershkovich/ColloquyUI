Dear Miss Crosby,
I am very sorry not to have been able to write to you for this fortnight. I have been ill and very weak and weary.
I thank you very much for your good letter. Your brother[1] was to me much more than an ordinary acquaintance. He was one of those rare people whom I met in life with whom I felt from the beginning I could think and feel in common.
But not only this: I had a hearty sympathy for him. I felt it keenly last week when I got an American paper, «The Public», in which I found a very good likeness of him.[2] I could not retain my tears when I looked at it.
If his death is such a great loss for me and his friends (I think it is the same for his country), how heavy the loss must be for you and his nearest relations?
With true feeling of condolence and high esteem
I am, yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
12 February 1907.

Дорогая мисс Кросби,
остаюсь искренне ваш
Лев Толстой.
