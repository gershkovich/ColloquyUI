Dear friend Allen Clarke,
I was glad to have news from you. I wish success to your scheme. It is the beginning of a great and very important work which will be done sooner or later. Your book translated in russian is very much apreciated. Now I will try to translate one of your novels. I have not yet read them but judging by the opinions of the press and my own based on the book what I know — they must have the same merits as the «Factory System».[1]
Your friend Leo Tolstoy.

Дорогой друг Аллен Кларк,
Ваш друг Лев Толстой.
