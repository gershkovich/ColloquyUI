Mr. Sidney С. Cockerell.
Dear Sir,
I safely received the books you sent me as well as the portrait of More and thank you very much.[1] I have not yet had the time to read them. I postpone it for the automn and winter if J will live till then. Your visit has left me a very agreable impression.
With sympathy yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
