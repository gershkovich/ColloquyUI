Dear Friend,
I just received your letter and your book: «The Indian Home Rule».
I read your book with great interest because I think that the question you treat in it: the passive resistance — is a question of the greatest importance, not only for India but for the whole humanity.
I could not find your former letters but came across your biography by J.Doss[1] which too interested me much and gave me the possibity to know and understand you better.
I am not quite well at present and therefore abstain from writing to you all what I have to say about your book and all your work which I appreciate very much, but I will do it as soon as I feel better.[2]
Your friend and brother
