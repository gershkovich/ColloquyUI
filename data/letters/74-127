Dear Mr. Ferris,
It is for the last time I answer your letter. I beg you to understand that I cannot avail myself to your desire, I do not presume that I know all that is to be known, but it is not through spiritualism that I intend to seek the truth.
I beg you not to come. I have neither the time nor the wish to receive you, so I hope that there will be no more question of your coming here to see me.
