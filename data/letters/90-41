Moscow.
A. St. John.
I thank you very much for your letter,[1] dear friend. I heard of your illness and am very glad to know that you are rid of it. Nathalie G.[2] and Mascha Shanks[3] have been here yesterday and we spoke with them very much about you.
It is strange to say it, but I was glad to know of the faults of the D[uchobors].[4] There are no shadows in the pictures that they draw of them, and they seem not to be real.
I think that it is very good for them to have such friends as you and others of our friends. You are the consciousness of their principles, and with your help they feel more vividly their faults. I think that illness has lowered their spirit. Say them, please that I will do what I can to take them from Cyprus, and I hope that I will be succesful. If I could[5] write Russian, my letter would be very long because I wish to say many things to you, but as I cannot do it, I must finish my letter.
With true brotherly love,
Leo Tolstoy.
Please forward my letter to Potapoff and Веригин.[6]
