Dear sir.
I received your book «The Immortal Pilot» and have begun to read it. By the two first chapters that I have read I think that I will completely agree with the contents of the book, and the style of it is very good.
Thanking you for the book I remain yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.

Милостивый государь,
Лев Толстой.
