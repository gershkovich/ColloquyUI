Dear Friend,
I received your letter[1] and the draft for ninety-two roubles, and will send it to Tchertkoff, who will forward it to its destination. I am sorry that Tchertkoff adressed himself through you to the Society of Friends, and will avow it to you, that it is very disagreable to me, that I have something to do with this matter.[2] If I thought, that it is good for a Christian to have money at his disposal and that good could be done by money, I would have kept my fortune and would help people by my money. But as I think, that a Christian ought not to have any property and that it is impossible to do any good through money, I can never ask for money, nor for me, nor for anybody else. If people find right, as you do, to give their money to other men and will do it through me, as they did in the time of the famine, I will do as they wish, but I would rather not have anything to do with money matters, which are always full of sin. And this is an example of it. You are not rich, but nevertheless you gave a good sum of money with the best wishes, and this gift of yours has awakened in me very bad feelings: it seemed to me, that you must reproach me of inconsistency or in want of delicacy, if not asking, letting others ask money for my friends from strangers, when the members of my family are rich.
Excuse me for saying all this, but I prefer to be sincere with you, because I like and esteem you very much, and have retained from our intercourse the most kind remembrances.
You have heard, I think, of the persecution of the Duchobori, that is going on in the Caucasus. I have sent a correspondence about it to my friend Mr. John Kenworthy (London) and it will, I hope, appear very soon in the English papers.
With best love, your friend
Leo Tolstoy.
