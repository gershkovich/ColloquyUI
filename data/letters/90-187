20 October 1899.
Dear Mr. Stadling,
I received 250 roubles destined for the famine stricken, and thank you and the givers for the kind gift. There is no more organised help in Kasan, Samara and Orenbourg, so that I will try to use this money for needy Russian people in the south of Russia, or for the Douchobory in Siberia where they are very poor, if you have nothing against it.
I am sorry that your health is not getting better, and hope that you will soon recover and be so strong and active as before.
Yours truly,
Leo Tolstoy.
