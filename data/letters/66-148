Honoured Sir.
I have received both your letter and a letter from Banking House of Gilman Son & C°, both letters announcing the fact of 200 having been cabled me for the use of our famine stricken peasantry.
I am afraid there has been some mistake, as I have not yet received the money and I should be very grateful if you were to let me know how the money was addressed and to what Banking House it was sent, so that I might be able to acknowledge the receipt of it.[1] At any rate let me tell you how deeply thankful we feel for the help which arrives so plentifully from your country, and let me beg you to express my heartfelt gratitude to those members of your Sunday School who have so generously contributed to our Famine Fund.
With cordial regard
Believe me,
Yours truly Leo Tolstoy.
Милостивый государь,
С сердечным приветом
остаюсь
уважающий вас Лев Толстой.
