Dear friend,
There has been lately a dreadful persecution in the Caucasus of a so called sect of Duchobory. One of our friends went to the Caucasus especially with the purpose to know the truth about this matter.[1] He has written the description of this persecution and I have written a little preface to this description. I should like very much to publish all this in the most widespread English papers. In which paper will you advise me to send the article? Would you undertake this affair? And if so, can I send you the article in Russian? It would save time. I think you are in relation with Mr. Rapoport[2] and he could do the translation. His translations are very good. The article will contain about 40,000 letters.
Please answer as soon as possible.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
30 September 1895.
Дорогой друг,
Искренно ваш
Лев Толстой.
