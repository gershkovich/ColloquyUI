Dear young friend,
Do not think and believe that you are too young to wrestle with the evil, the egotism, that is in us all. Our true life consist only in this wrestling and we are never too old nor too young for it. Your letter to the Bishop[1] is very true and good. I wish you steady progress in your spiritual i. e. true life.
Your friend
Leo Tolstoy.

Дорогой юный друг,
