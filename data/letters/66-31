Dear sister!
I was very glad to receive your letter and to know that there are people who live as you live and that you know me and wish to have intercourse with me.
Please give me more particulars about your kind of living: have you property, how do you manage it, are you non-resistants? What you write me about your taking low positions, working as servants, your laboring with your hands and your freedom of all a[c]knowledged confessions seems to me to be true conditions of a christian life. But I will be quite sincere — I hope you will be the same to me — and tell you what seems to me not right in your way of living. I think that to abandon husbands wifes and children is a mistake. A Christian I think must learn to live with all men as with brothers and sisters; and husbands, wifes and children should not make an exception. The more it is difficult for a Christian to establish brotherly relations between himself and his nearest relations, the more he must try to do it.
The other thing that I do not approuve is that you do not allow your children to mix with the external world. I think a Christian must not enclose himself and his children in a narrow circle of his com[m]unity, but must try to act towards the whole world as if the whole world where his community and so he must educate the children.
Please explain to me your words «when we received the light». How did you receive it? and what do you understand by the word «light»?
Please also give me more details of the history of your community, I will be very thankful for it.
My adress is: Tula, Russia.
Thanking you again for your letter I remain
Yours truly
L. Tolstoy.
22 September.
Дорогая сестра,
истинно ваш Л. Толстой.
