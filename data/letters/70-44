Dear Sir,
I have received Your book[1] and have read it. I think it is very good and renders in a concise form quite truly the chief ideas of my book. I hope that this book in this new form will be usefull, in the sense in which I intented it to be, to a larger public than original.
With my best thanks and wishes for the success of Your book, I am, dear Sir,
Yours truly.
искренно ваш.
