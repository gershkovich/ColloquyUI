Dear Sir,
I have received your letter. If you write Moscow, it will always reach me.
I was very glad to hear, that through the same means, I mean the Christian doctrine, you came to the same conclusion as myself, i. e. to free yourself from all worldly authority and to obey only your conscience and the commands of Christ. I think, that in our pagan society organization it is impossible to be a true Christian without opposing the exigencies of governements, and that a man, who is in earnest, cannot fail to be desobedient to government, if he wish to act in accordance with his conscience. And I think it is greatly time, that men should begin to act so. I am therefore very anxious to hear your story, as you call it.
Expecting to have news from you, I remain
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
Милостивый государь,
искренно ваш
Л. Толстой.
