Dear young friend,
Your letter gave me great pleasure. I think that you are quite right in your appreciation of the church and state superstition. But I don’t agree with you in your idea that the brotherhood of men is the aim to which ought to tend all our activity. The brotherhood of men is not an aim to which we must tend but the necessary result of our rightly, by our religious consciousness, i. e. by the establishment of the relation of our life to the All, to God, directed activity. — This religious consciousness requires from us a strongly definite line of conduct and the brotherhood of men is only one of the many goods which necessarily results from such a conduct.
May be that you are of the same conviction and therefore what I say to you is quite useless. In any case I think that you are in the right way and I wish you progress on it. I will be glad to know more of your life.
Your friend
