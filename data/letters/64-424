Dear Madam.
Александр Никифорович Дунаев, директор Торгового банка, на Ильинке. This is the ad[d]ress of M[r] Doonaieff a friend of mine who will tell you all about tokology which is being translated by a friend of his M[r] Dolgoff.[1] I am very sorry that I am not in Moscou and will not have the opportunity of making your personal acquaintance, if Toula is not on your way and you will not come to us. We would be very happy to see you. M[r] Dona[i]eff will tell you all what you can wish to know about the journey.[2]
Yours truly
L. Tolstoy.
P. S. If it could happen that M[r] D[oonaieff] should not be in town or you could not see him please call at our house in Moscou Хамовники, д. № 15 where you will find my son[3] who will be happy to be useful to you.
Искренно ваш Л. Толстой.
