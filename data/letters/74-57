Dear Percy Redfern,
I think your friend who is against books and reading is quite right.
Lao Tze says: true words are not pleasant, pleasant words are not true. The wise are not learned, the learned are not wise.
The Brahmanes say that in their books there are many predictions of times in which it will rain. But press those books as strongly as you can, you can not get out of them a drop of water. So you can not get out of all the books that contain the best preceptes the smalest good deed.
Ruskin says, that the best men, those which have done the greatest good to humanity are those that we do not know of.
The chief difference between words and deeds is, that words are always intended for men for their aprobation, but deeds can be done only for God.
Though it is possible to utter words only with the intention to fulfill the will of God it is very difficult not to think about the impression w[h]ich they will produce on men and not to form them accordingly. But deeds you can do quite unknown to men only for God. And such deeds are the greatest joy that a man can experience.
As to his plan to live amongst prostitutes and tramps... I can not say that I approuve of it. Rather not. I think that to change own’s habitual life for such a one a man must [be] quite sure to be proof against the new temptations that will assail him in this new life.
This refers also to your doubts about your life.
I think that the changes in our life must come from the impossibility to live otherwise than accordingly to the demands of our conscience but not from our mental resolution to try a new form of life.
I was glad to hear all what you write about your society 1 and yourself and thank you for your letter.
Your friend Leo Tolstoy.
Дорогой Перси Редферн,
Ваш друг Лев Толстой.
