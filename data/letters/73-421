Dear Sir,
I thank you for sending me your book «The moral damage of War». I have looked it through and think that it is a very useful book. But unluckily there are very few people who have ears to hear. Nevertheless, I think it is our duty to propagate the truth that we know as much as we can. And you have done it in writing this very good book.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.

Милостивый государь,
Искренно ваш
