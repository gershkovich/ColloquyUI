* 184. Джорджу Блеггу (George Blagg). Черновое.
Dear m-r Blagg. I thank you heartily for your letter. It is the greatest joy of my life to find myself in unity of religious feelings with working people like you, who are free from superstitious creeds and believe in the teaching of Christ in its application to our life. I think that this is the only way of the establishing of the Kingdom of God on the earth.
Thanking you again for your letter I am yours truly
14 oct. 97.
