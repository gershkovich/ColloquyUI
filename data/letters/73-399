Mr Herbert Welsh.
Dear Sir,
I received your letter, book and pamphlets.[1]
I can not help to admire your activity, but the crimes which have been committed in the Philippines are special cases, which by my opinion, will allways occur in states governed by violence or in which violence is admitted as necessary and lawfull.
Violence, which in itself is a crime, can not be used to a certain extent. When it is admitted it will allways transgress the limits which we would put to it. Deeds as those than have been done in the Philippines, in China and are daily done in all pseudochristian states will continue till humanity will accept violence as a means to produce good results and will not accept the chief precepts of Christianity — to act on our brethern not as on animals by violence, but by sweet reasonableness (as Mat[t]h[ew] Arnold[2] termed it) which is the only way to act thoroughly and durably on reasonable beings.
Hoping that my bad English will not hinder you to understand what I mean to say, I remain, dear Sir,
yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
15 Dec. 1902.
Г. Герберту Уелшу.
Милостивый государь,
искренно ваш
Лев Толстой.
