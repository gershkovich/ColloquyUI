Dear friend,
I beg you to pardon me for not answering your letter, which gave me great pleasure, for such a long time. Please to receive my warmest thanks for it and for the pamphlets.[1] It is a great joy for me to know that such ideas as those that are expressed in your address are approved by a great majority. I am not so hopeful as you are on the results of the Czar’s note,[2] and have explained my reason for it that I will have the pleasure to send to you when it will be translated.
Thanking you for your sympathy to my activity and hoping that a part of what you say about it would be true, I am, dear friend,
Yours truly,
Leo Tolstoy.
24 January 1899.
 
Дорогой друг,
уважающий вас
