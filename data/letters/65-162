* 162. Бернс и К[о] (Burnz and С[o]).
I received your letter and book safety and thank you very much for them. The book was very welcome and I think its propagation will do much good.
I immediately wrote a small article on its contents[1] and made free to join to it your [letter and sent it to a][2] very popular journal (the Week)[3], from which it is reprinted in many periodicals. Although I do not quite agree with all your views, as you can see from my epilogue to the «Son[ata of] Cr[eutzer]».[4]I find your work very useful and thank you again for communicating it to me.
Yours truly L. T.
Искренно ваш Л. Т.
