Dear Sir,
I read the paper that you sent me with great attention. I am sorry to say that this theory of non-resistance, implying obedience to bad powers and therefore participation in violent, bad and cruel acts, is a very bad sophistry. We must not resist evil, but must not take part in it. And there in the cases, where you must abstain from doing what you are asked or ordered to do, is the chief point of the principle of non-resistance. A man who will do all what he is ordered to do — if it is good or bad, if it corresponds or not to the will of God which is the foundation, the essence of our life — is a man who consciously or inconsciously deceives himself. I am sorry that my opinion differs so much from yours theory which seems to please you so much, but I wish to be quite frank with you.
Yours truly L. Tolstoy.
