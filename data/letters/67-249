Dear Madam,
I received your letter with the money, destined to be employed for needy Russian peasant women. I will try to make the best use of it in giving it to a family, which suffered from fire. I thank you and the givers of the money for their kindness. I read your adress on arbitration and was interested in it. I think that the warfare between capitalists and workmen can not be terminated by compulsion, i. e. by force, and I was glad to see, that you are of the same opinion and that you mean under compulsion moral influence and public opinion. —
I heartily wish you success in your work.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
17/29 October 1894.
