Dear Sir,
T[h]ough I have no reason to suppose that you will publish my letter to you,[1] I beg you not to do it.
I am sorry to have written this letter expressing in it my opinion of the Princess’s conduct.[2] I have no moral right to do it and as a man who tries to live according to Christ’s teaching should not have done it.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
3, 16 Febr. 1903.
Милостивый государь,
Искренно ваш
Лев Толстой.
