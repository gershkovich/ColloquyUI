Dear Mr. Stadling,
I was very glad to have news from you and such good news: you are in London, you are well, are energetic as always and in relation with my friend and coworker Mr. Kenworthy. I was ashamed to read your description of our work in Riazan, but I knew it was due only to your friendship, and [I am] very glad of it.
My wife and daughters and my son Lioff send you their hearty greetings.
Yours truly
Дорогой господин Стадлинг,
Искренно ваш
