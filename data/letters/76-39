Dear Mr. Stead,
I have received your letter a[nd] the preface to your article.[1] I was glad to receive your letter, but your preface did not please me at all. It is not serious, and we, old men, at our time of life wish to be serious.
I am sorry not to be able to comply with y[ou]r wish about writing something for y[ou]r readers.
I am very busy a[nd] have little time left. But I will be glad to see you.
Leo Tolstoy.

Дорогой г-н Стэд,
