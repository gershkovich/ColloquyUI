Dear sir,
I received your letter and the 12 № of the Review of Religions and thank you for both. Many articles are very interesting, but I am sorry that they are for the most part polemic against the Churches. I don’t say that they are not convincing, but I think that they are useless. I read also «The teachings of the promised Messiah». It is quite true that they don’t contain anything quite against reason but I have not found in them anything now or expressed better than it was expressed before.
I quite agree with you that the greatest evil of our time is the absence of true religion, and I think that every person which has in itself a religious feeling must try to communicate it to his neighbours by all means, especially by a good life. And that is all what we want and therefore ought to do in our time.
Yours truly Leo Tolstoy.
