Dear Aylmer Maude,
La Revue Blanche of last March contained a brief statement of views attributed to me on the sex question, followed by the opinions of a number of French authors concerning those views.
The opinions there attributed to me are grotesquely absurd, and are a careless, second-hand, and incorrect summary of a collection of undated extracts and articles put together and published by my friend Vladimir Tchertkoff.
The curious thing is, that of all the authors who express themselves on the subject, not one suspected that he was being hoaxed. They all took the summary put before them as though it were a statement of my real opinions.
I am glad, therefore, to see in your preface to the «Revised Edition» of Resurrection[1] a restatement of my views on the sex-question which is as reasonable as the summary in La Revue Blanche is absurd.
Leo Tolstoy.
Дорогой Эйльмер Моод,
Лев Толстой.
