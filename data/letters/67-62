Dear Sir, I have not yet received the cuttings of your articles, in which I am very much interested, as in all, what you write. I feel in you a kindred spirit and it is a joy for me to be in communication with you. I read with great interest your «Anatomy of misery»,[1] and before I got it from you, I got a copy of it through a bookseller and had it translated in Russian. I thank you heartily for sending it to me. I received it in time. My book, the translation of the gospels,[2] is now being translated by a gentleman in Petersbourg — prof. Turner (Petersbourg university). If your publischer will write to him, he will know all about it.
With high regards yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
