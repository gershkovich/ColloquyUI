My answer to your question is that peace can never be attained by conferences <in which men who do not themselves go to the war. This question> and can be resolved <only> by men who do not talk only, but who <are obliged to fight> themselves go to war.
This question was resolved nearly 1900 years ago by the teaching of Christ, how it was meant by him and not how it was perverted by the churches.
All the conferences can be <solved> resumed in one sentence: all men are sons of God <and every man must love his neighbour and not kill him> and brothers and therefore must and ought to love and not to kill each other. Excuse my rudeness, all those conferences excite in me a very strong feeling of disgust for the hypocrisy which is so manifest in them.
