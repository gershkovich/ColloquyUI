Dear Sir,
I thank for the information you give me of the Douchobors. I was very pleased to see by the clip[p]ings of newspapers that you sent me, that the Canadian governement as well as the farmers behaved so well towards the Douchobors. I think that if what they did seems to be madness from a wordly point of view, nevertheless it will have a beneficient influence on many people who think that there can be only material motives for activity.
I could find fault with them only if I was convinced that they have neglected more important things than the use of animals. But as I don’t know it I can not judge them.
If I would not have advised them to do what they did I can not help admiring their abnegation for spiritual motives.
I hope that the arrival of Veriguine will have a good unfluence on them.
Thanking you again for your letter I remain
yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.

Милостивый государь,
искренно ваш
