Dear Mr Ryerson Jennings,
In answer to your letter of 24 August I can sincerely say that I wish Mr Bryan success in his candidature to the Presidency of the United States. From my own standpoint, repudiating as it does all coercive Government, I naturally cannot acquiesce with the position of President of the Republic; but since such functions still exist, it is obviously best that they should be occupied by individuals worthy of confidence.
Mr. Bryan I greatly respect and sympathise with, and know that the basis of his activity is kindred to mine in his sympathy with the interests of the working masses, his antimilitarism and his recognition of the fallacies produced by capitalism.
I do not know, but hope Mr. Bryan will stand for land reform according to the Single Tax system of Henry George, which I regard as being at the present time, of the most insistent necessity, and which every progressive reformer should place to the fore.
Yours faithfully
Leo Tolstoy.
