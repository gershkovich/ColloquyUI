Dear Sir,
I received your letter as well as the leaflet with the portrait of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and lately a specimen number of the «Review of Religions».[1] The proofs of the death of Jesus and the pretended discovery of his tomb are quite useless because no reasonable man can believe in resurrection. What belongs to the man Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, w[h]ich you call the promised Messiah, all what you write about him and what is written in the leaflet has no interest whatever for me.[2] We need no Messiah, we need only reasonable religious teaching and if Mirza Ahmad can teach men some new and reasonable doctrine I will be very glad to profit by it, but I know nothing of it.
In the «Specimen Number» I approuved very much two articles: «How to get rid of sin» and «The life to come», especially the second. The idea is very profound and very true. Thank you very much for sending this specimen, as well as for your letter.
Yours truly
Leo Tolstoy.
