Dear Sir,
I will be very glad to make the acquaintance of Mr. William Bryan[1] if he comes to Russia. Excuse me, dear Sir, if I make a little reproach to you. It was very painful to me to know that you published my opinion of Mr. Harper[1] and that I offended without wishing it a man who before your article could not have any ill feeling to me. In all other parts your interview is quite correct and very well written.
Yours truly
